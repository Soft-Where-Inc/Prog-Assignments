# Prog-Assignments
Collection of programming assignments, tutorials from various online resources.

## Moved Self-Study/ programs using [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories):

```
$ git remote add Self-Study /Users/agurajada/Personal/Self-Study
$ git fetch Self-Study --tags
$ git merge --allow-unrelated-histories Self-Study/main
$ git status
$ git remote remove Self-Study
```

## NOTE: Test data files

For various programs in this repo, all test data files, as needed, will be found
in the Prog-Assignments-TestData/ dir, on my personal Mac where these programs
were written.
The test-data dir is a sibling of the top-level Projects/Prog-Assignments/ subdir.
