# Linux/Seastar

Collection of tutorial programming assignments from [Seastar website]
(https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md)

This C++ framework only runs on Linux, so these tutorial programs were implemented
and tested on Ubuntu Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (jammy) distro of Linux.
