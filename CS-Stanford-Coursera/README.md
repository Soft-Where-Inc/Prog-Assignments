# CS-Stanford-Coursera/README.md

Programs are for Stanford Algorithms Class - assignments and practice problems.

## NOTE: Test data files

All test data files, as needed, will be found in the Prog-Assignments-TestData/
dir, on my personal Mac where these programs were written. The test-data dir
is a sibling of the top-level Projects/Prog-Assignments/ subdir.
